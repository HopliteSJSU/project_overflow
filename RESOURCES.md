## Resources

### React
- The best place to start with react is the react docs. https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html

- Also this github repo has a bunch of react tutorials if anyone wants to brush their concepts. https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links

- We will also be using React-Router https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/philosophy

- We will also use Redux which can be confusing here is the docs https://redux.js.org/

- Another resource which I have found helpful for redux is https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux. If you want to get a better idea of how it works I would highly reccommend that you implement it from the tutorial

### Node

- The best place for Node is the docs https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v9.x/api/. Also we will be using Express a web framework for Node https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html.

- We will use passport js for Authentication http://www.passportjs.org/docs/ and the Github Repo for examples https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport
- We will use Mongoose for Object Modeling for MongoDB https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html
- This is a list of express resources from Github https://github.com/rajikaimal/awesome-express
